( charmaine_0001 "Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore. " )
( charmaine_0002 "For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands. " )
( charmaine_0003 "Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil. " )
( charmaine_0004 "Will we ever forget it. " )
( charmaine_0005 "God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever. " )
( charmaine_0006 "And you always want to see it in the superlative degree. " )
( charmaine_0007 "Gad, your letter came just in time. " )
( charmaine_0008 "He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table. " )
( charmaine_0009 "I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game. " )
( charmaine_0010 "If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now. " )
( charmaine_0011 "Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet. " )
( charmaine_0012 "He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique. " )
( charmaine_0013 "Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed. " )
( charmaine_0014 "It's the aurora borealis. " )
( charmaine_0015 "There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep. " )
( charmaine_0016 "From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy. " )
( charmaine_0017 "There was a change now. " )
( charmaine_0018 "I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances. " )
( charmaine_0019 "Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories. " )
( charmaine_0020 "It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it. " )
( charmaine_0021 "Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition. " )
( charmaine_0022 "A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges. " )
( charmaine_0023 "It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy. " )
( charmaine_0024 "I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed. " )
( charmaine_0025 "It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting. " )
( charmaine_0026 "To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor. " )
( charmaine_0027 "Robbery, bribery, fraud,  " )
( charmaine_0028 "Their forces were already moving into the north country. " )
( charmaine_0029 "I had faith in them. " )
( charmaine_0030 "They were three hundred yards apart. " )
( charmaine_0031 "Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step. " )
( charmaine_0032 "He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson. " )
( charmaine_0033 "Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children. " )
( charmaine_0034 "He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes. " )
( charmaine_0035 "She turned in at the hotel. " )
( charmaine_0036 "I was the only one who remained sitting. " )
( charmaine_0037 "We'll have to watch our chances. " )
( charmaine_0038 "The ship should be in within a week or ten days. " )
( charmaine_0039 "I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here. " )
( charmaine_0040 "Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell. " )
( charmaine_0041 "How could he explain his possession of the sketch. " )
( charmaine_0042 "It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson. " )
( charmaine_0043 "Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip. " )
( charmaine_0044 "He moved away as quietly as he had come. " )
( charmaine_0045 "The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear. " )
( charmaine_0046 "Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog. " )
( charmaine_0047 "He looked at the handkerchief more, closely. " )
( charmaine_0048 "Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin. " )
( charmaine_0049 "In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously. " )
( charmaine_0050 "The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow. " )
( charmaine_0051 "It was a curious coincidence. " )
( charmaine_0052 "Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief. " )
( charmaine_0053 "There was nothing on the rock. " )
( charmaine_0054 "Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound. " )
( charmaine_0055 "Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly. " )
( charmaine_0056 "I have no idea, replied Philip. " )
( charmaine_0057 "I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else. " )
( charmaine_0058 "His immaculate appearance was gone. " )
( charmaine_0059 "Anyway, no one saw her like that. " )
( charmaine_0060 "Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him. " )
( charmaine_0061 "The men stared into each other's face. " )
( charmaine_0062 "Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger. " )
( charmaine_0063 "The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments. " )
( charmaine_0064 "They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel. " )
( charmaine_0065 "He saw Jeanne falter for a moment. " )
( charmaine_0066 "Surely I will excuse you, she cried. " )
( charmaine_0067 "In a flash Philip followed its direction. " )
( charmaine_0068 "It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father. " )
( charmaine_0069 "He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there. " )
( charmaine_0070 "What was the object of your little sensation. " )
( charmaine_0071 "But who was Eileen's double. " )
( charmaine_0072 "The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them. " )
( charmaine_0073 "And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him. " )
( charmaine_0074 "There has been a change, she interrupted him. " )
( charmaine_0075 "The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened. " )
( charmaine_0076 "It is the fire, partly, she said. " )
( charmaine_0077 "Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her. " )
( charmaine_0078 "It was a large canoe. " )
( charmaine_0079 "What if Jeanne failed him. " )
( charmaine_0080 "What if she did not come to the rock. " )
( charmaine_0081 "His face was streaming with blood. " )
( charmaine_0082 "A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes. " )
( charmaine_0083 "Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open. " )
( charmaine_0084 "A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face. " )
( charmaine_0085 "Death had come with terrible suddenness. " )
( charmaine_0086 "Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man. " )
( charmaine_0087 "He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling. " )
( charmaine_0088 "The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by. " )
( charmaine_0089 "The singing voice approached rapidly. " )
( charmaine_0090 "His blood grew hot with rage at the thought. " )
( charmaine_0091 "He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores. " )
( charmaine_0092 "For a full minute he crouched and listened. " )
( charmaine_0093 "He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire. " )
( charmaine_0094 "A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision. " )
( charmaine_0095 "Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest. " )
( charmaine_0096 "Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow. " )
( charmaine_0097 "Shall I carry you. " )
( charmaine_0098 "A maddening joy pounded in his brain. " )
( charmaine_0099 "You must sleep, he urged. " )
( charmaine_0100 "You, you would not keep the truth from me. " )
( charmaine_0101 "He will follow us soon. " )
( charmaine_0102 "But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe. " )
( charmaine_0103 "She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child. " )
( charmaine_0104 "Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe. " )
( charmaine_0105 "The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob. " )
( charmaine_0106 "If you only could know how I thank you. " )
( charmaine_0107 "He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself. " )
( charmaine_0108 "Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you. " )
( charmaine_0109 "Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely. " )
( charmaine_0110 "Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children. " )
( charmaine_0111 "He was wounded in the arm. " )
( charmaine_0112 "I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians. " )
( charmaine_0113 "Her words sent a strange chill through Philip. " )
( charmaine_0114 "He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him. " )
( charmaine_0115 "Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin. " )
( charmaine_0116 "She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice. " )
( charmaine_0117 "Pierre obeys me when we are together. " )
( charmaine_0118 "Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward. " )
( charmaine_0119 "My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante. " )
( charmaine_0120 "They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours. " )
( charmaine_0121 "Two years ago I gave up civilization for this. " )
( charmaine_0122 "She had died from cold and starvation. " )
( charmaine_0123 "It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks. " )
( charmaine_0124 "He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself. " )
( charmaine_0125 "Each day she became a more vital part of him. " )
( charmaine_0126 "It was a temptation, but he resisted it. " )
( charmaine_0127 "This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born. " )
( charmaine_0128 "Her face was against his breast. " )
( charmaine_0129 "She was his now, forever. " )
( charmaine_0130 "Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom. " )
( charmaine_0131 "A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips. " )
( charmaine_0132 "Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength. " )
( charmaine_0133 "He obeyed the pressure of her hand. " )
( charmaine_0134 "I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre. " )
( charmaine_0135 "About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age. " )
( charmaine_0136 "Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure. " )
( charmaine_0137 "In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne. " )
( charmaine_0138 "He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes. " )
( charmaine_0139 "Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this. " )
( charmaine_0140 "It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God. " )
( charmaine_0141 "Such things had occurred before, he told Philip. " )
( charmaine_0142 "Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed. " )
( charmaine_0143 "But there was something even more startling than this resemblance. " )
( charmaine_0144 "I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily. " )
( charmaine_0145 "Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued. " )
( charmaine_0146 "A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness. " )
( charmaine_0147 "Now these things had been struck dead within him. " )
( charmaine_0148 "For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky. " )
( charmaine_0149 "Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted. " )
( charmaine_0150 "And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare. " )
( charmaine_0151 "Philip thrust himself against it and entered. " )
( charmaine_0152 "MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger. " )
( charmaine_0153 "He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black. " )
( charmaine_0154 "Won't you draw up, gentlemen. " )
( charmaine_0155 "A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned. " )
( charmaine_0156 "He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice. " )
( charmaine_0157 "Does that look good. " )
( charmaine_0158 "They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life. " )
( charmaine_0159 "You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt. " )
( charmaine_0160 "Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub. " )
( charmaine_0161 "That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe. " )
( charmaine_0162 "Philip made no effort to follow. " )
( charmaine_0163 "He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne. " )
( charmaine_0164 "They are to attack your camp tomorrow night. " )
( charmaine_0165 "Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding. " )
( charmaine_0166 "I was near the cabin, and saw you. " )
( charmaine_0167 "Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting. " )
( charmaine_0168 "Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant. " )
( charmaine_0169 "There was none of the joy of meeting in his face. " )
( charmaine_0170 "And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen. " )
( charmaine_0171 "Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar. " )
( charmaine_0172 "The date was nearly eighteen years old. " )
( charmaine_0173 "They were the presage of storm. " )
( charmaine_0174 "Down there the earth was already swelling with life. " )
( charmaine_0175 "For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap. " )
( charmaine_0176 "She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled. " )
( charmaine_0177 "Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated. " )
( charmaine_0178 "Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said. " )
( charmaine_0179 "If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed. " )
( charmaine_0180 "So cheer up, and give us your paw. " )
( charmaine_0181 "This time he did not yap for mercy. " )
( charmaine_0182 "And the air was growing chilly. " )
( charmaine_0183 "Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two. " )
( charmaine_0184 "The questions may have come vaguely in his mind. " )
( charmaine_0185 "Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl. " )
( charmaine_0186 "Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine. " )
( charmaine_0187 "Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass. " )
( charmaine_0188 "The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying. " )
( charmaine_0189 "Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent. " )
( charmaine_0190 "For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone. " )
( charmaine_0191 "He did not rush in. " )
( charmaine_0192 "It was edged with ice. " )
( charmaine_0193 "He drank of the water cautiously. " )
( charmaine_0194 "But a strange thing happened. " )
( charmaine_0195 "He began to follow the footprints of the dog. " )
( charmaine_0196 "Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose. " )
( charmaine_0197 "Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions. " )
( charmaine_0198 "Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day. " )
( charmaine_0199 "He leapt again, and the club caught him once more. " )
( charmaine_0200 "He cried, and swung the club wildly. " )
( charmaine_0201 "She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face. " )
( charmaine_0202 "They were following the shore of a lake. " )
( charmaine_0203 "The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him. " )
( charmaine_0204 "From now on we're pals. " )
( charmaine_0205 "He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau. " )
( charmaine_0206 "How much was it. " )
( charmaine_0207 "Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression. " )
( charmaine_0208 "It was not a large lake, and almost round. " )
( charmaine_0209 "Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards. " )
( charmaine_0210 "It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made. " )
( charmaine_0211 "Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman. " )
( charmaine_0212 "Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound. " )
( charmaine_0213 "Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head. " )
( charmaine_0214 "They die out of spite. " )
( charmaine_0215 "The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him. " )
( charmaine_0216 "Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive. " )
( charmaine_0217 "The ringing of the big bell aroused him. " )
( charmaine_0218 "At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened. " )
( charmaine_0219 "A dead man is of no use on a plantation. " )
( charmaine_0220 "I don't know why you're here at all. " )
( charmaine_0221 "What part of the United States is your home. " )
( charmaine_0222 "My, I'm almost homesick for it already. " )
( charmaine_0223 "She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist. " )
( charmaine_0224 "I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up. " )
( charmaine_0225 "That came before my A B C's. " )
( charmaine_0226 "It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles. " )
( charmaine_0227 "But it contributed to the smash. " )
( charmaine_0228 "The last one I knew was an overseer. " )
( charmaine_0229 "Do you know any good land around here. " )
( charmaine_0230 "The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia. " )
( charmaine_0231 "I cannot follow you, she said. " )
( charmaine_0232 "I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me. " )
( charmaine_0233 "Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil. " )
( charmaine_0234 "His voice was passionately rebellious. " )
( charmaine_0235 "Don't you see I hate you. " )
( charmaine_0236 "So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves. " )
( charmaine_0237 "It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon. " )
( charmaine_0238 "He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter. " )
( charmaine_0239 "Wash your hands of me. " )
( charmaine_0240 "I think it's much nicer to quarrel. " )
( charmaine_0241 "I saw it when she rolled. " )
( charmaine_0242 "I only read the quotations. " )
( charmaine_0243 "He was the soul of devotion to his employers. " )
( charmaine_0244 "Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year. " )
( charmaine_0245 "You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi. " )
( charmaine_0246 "They ought to pass here some time today. " )
( charmaine_0247 "I had been sad too long already. " )
( charmaine_0248 "All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy. " )
( charmaine_0249 "He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition. " )
( charmaine_0250 "I may manage to freight a cargo back as well. " )
( charmaine_0251 "O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals. " )
( charmaine_0252 "He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino. " )
( charmaine_0253 "Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller. " )
( charmaine_0254 "You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that. " )
( charmaine_0255 "See the length of the body and that elongated neck. " )
( charmaine_0256 "They are coming ashore, whoever they are. " )
( charmaine_0257 "Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays. " )
( charmaine_0258 "Think of investing in such an adventure. " )
( charmaine_0259 "Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all. " )
( charmaine_0260 "I have been doubly baptized. " )
( charmaine_0261 "They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha. " )
( charmaine_0262 "Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed. " )
( charmaine_0263 "And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young. " )
( charmaine_0264 "The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment. " )
( charmaine_0265 "They handled two men already, both grub-thieves. " )
( charmaine_0266 "Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow. " )
( charmaine_0267 "Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened. " )
( charmaine_0268 "That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands. " )
( charmaine_0269 "And after the bath a shave would not be bad. " )
( charmaine_0270 "Now please give a plain statement of what occurred. " )
( charmaine_0271 "You can take a vacation on pay. " )
( charmaine_0272 "They are big trees and require plenty of room. " )
( charmaine_0273 "And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house. " )
( charmaine_0274 "There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them. " )
( charmaine_0275 "Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference. " )
( charmaine_0276 "McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin. " )
( charmaine_0277 "It would give me nervous prostration. " )
( charmaine_0278 "She said with chattering teeth. " )
( charmaine_0279 "I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes. " )
( charmaine_0280 "I do not blame you for anything; remember that. " )
( charmaine_0281 "If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly. " )
( charmaine_0282 "The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant. " )
( charmaine_0283 "There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes. " )
( charmaine_0284 "But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine. " )
( charmaine_0285 "Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping. " )
( charmaine_0286 "Keep an eye on him. " )
( charmaine_0287 "Those are my oysters, he said at last. " )
( charmaine_0288 "They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued. " )
( charmaine_0289 "One by one the boys were captured. " )
( charmaine_0290 "The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted. " )
( charmaine_0291 "Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred. " )
( charmaine_0292 "They were deep in the primeval forest. " )
( charmaine_0293 "He had been foiled in his attempt to escape. " )
( charmaine_0294 "And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows. " )
( charmaine_0295 "Bassett was a fastidious man. " )
( charmaine_0296 "There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts. " )
( charmaine_0297 "This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill. " )
( charmaine_0298 "I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot. " )
( charmaine_0299 "From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror. " )
( charmaine_0300 "But all my dreams violated this law. " )
( charmaine_0301 "It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis. " )
( charmaine_0302 "But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality. " )
( charmaine_0303 "I graduated last of my class. " )
( charmaine_0304 "They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs. " )
( charmaine_0305 "He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary. " )
( charmaine_0306 "Very early in my life, I separated from my mother. " )
( charmaine_0307 "His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it. " )
( charmaine_0308 "White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer. " )
( charmaine_0309 "Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply. " )
( charmaine_0310 "Therefore, hurrah for the game. " )
( charmaine_0311 "It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass. " )
( charmaine_0312 "Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain. " )
( charmaine_0313 "Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World. " )
( charmaine_0314 "Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy. " )
( charmaine_0315 "We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once. " )
( charmaine_0316 "He was a wise hyena. " )
( charmaine_0317 "Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself. " )
( charmaine_0318 "And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom. " )
( charmaine_0319 "With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face. " )
( charmaine_0320 "The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift. " )
( charmaine_0321 "This is a common experience with all of us. " )
( charmaine_0322 "He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat. " )
( charmaine_0323 "It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily. " )
( charmaine_0324 "Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish. " )
( charmaine_0325 "Cherokee identified himself with his instinct. " )
( charmaine_0326 "They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements. " )
( charmaine_0327 "The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves. " )
( charmaine_0328 "Ah, indeed. " )
( charmaine_0329 "Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed. " )
( charmaine_0330 "Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared. " )
( charmaine_0331 "Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm. " )
( charmaine_0332 "This is no place for you. " )
( charmaine_0333 "He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time. " )
( charmaine_0334 "Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down. " )
( charmaine_0335 "So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet. " )
( charmaine_0336 "Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally. " )
( charmaine_0337 "The fighting had now become intermittent. " )
( charmaine_0338 "They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands. " )
( charmaine_0339 "It was like the beating of hoofs. " )

( charmaine_0350 "It was more like sugar. " )
( charmaine_0351 "I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah. " )
( charmaine_0352 "Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out. " )
( charmaine_0353 "Fresh meat they failed to obtain. " )

( charmaine_0357 "They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them. " )
( charmaine_0358 "Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan. " )
( charmaine_0359 "But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion. " )
( charmaine_0360 "But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully. " )
( charmaine_0361 "Nope, not the slightest idea. " )
( charmaine_0362 "It is not an attempt to smash the market. " )
( charmaine_0363 "We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more. " )
( charmaine_0364 "These rumors may even originate with us. " )
( charmaine_0365 "A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth. " )
( charmaine_0366 "There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not. " )
( charmaine_0367 "I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings. " )
( charmaine_0368 "In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban. " )
( charmaine_0369 "He saw all men in the business game doing this. " )
( charmaine_0370 "It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal. " )
( charmaine_0371 "He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way. " )
( charmaine_0372 "Points of view, new ideas, life. " )
( charmaine_0373 "But life's worth more than cash, she argued. " )
( charmaine_0374 "The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants. " )
( charmaine_0375 "Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week. " )
( charmaine_0376 "This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place. " )
( charmaine_0377 "That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged. " )
( charmaine_0378 "How old are you, daddy. " )
( charmaine_0379 "But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth. " )
( charmaine_0380 "My name's Ferguson. " )
( charmaine_0381 "Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man. " )
( charmaine_0382 "To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising. " )
( charmaine_0383 "The farmer works the soil and produces grain. " )
( charmaine_0384 "That's what Carnegie did. " )
( charmaine_0385 "I can't argue with you, and you know that. " )
( charmaine_0386 "Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab. " )
( charmaine_0387 "It was my idea to a tee. " )
( charmaine_0388 "Mab, she said. " )
( charmaine_0389 "I'll go over tomorrow afternoon. " )
( charmaine_0390 "But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith. " )
( charmaine_0391 "There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable. " )
( charmaine_0392 "Already he had begun borrowing from the banks. " )
( charmaine_0393 "It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under. " )
( charmaine_0394 "As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily. " )
( charmaine_0395 "A rising tide of fat had submerged them. " )
( charmaine_0396 "Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically. " )
( charmaine_0397 "In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur. " )
( charmaine_0398 "And here's another idea. " )
( charmaine_0399 "Manuel had one besetting sin. " )
( charmaine_0400 "The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club. " )
( charmaine_0401 "Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. " )
( charmaine_0402 "His newborn cunning gave him poise and control. " )
( charmaine_0403 "Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box. " )
( charmaine_0404 "It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work. " )
( charmaine_0405 "And that was the last of Francois and Perrault. " )
( charmaine_0406 "Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc. " )
( charmaine_0407 "The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. " )
( charmaine_0408 "He could feel a new stir in the land. " )
( charmaine_0409 "So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well. " )
( charmaine_0410 "It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand. " )
( charmaine_0411 "There is another virtue in these bulkheads. " )
( charmaine_0412 "But I am at the end of my resources. " )
( charmaine_0413 "Now our figuring was all right. " )
( charmaine_0414 "It lasted as a deterrent for two days. " )
( charmaine_0415 "The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour. " )
( charmaine_0416 "It is also an insidious, deceitful sun. " )
( charmaine_0417 "The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer. " )
( charmaine_0418 "The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian. " )
( charmaine_0419 "When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically. " )
( charmaine_0420 "By golly, the boy wins. " )
( charmaine_0421 "Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider. " )
( charmaine_0422 "McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu. " )
( charmaine_0423 "Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact. " )
( charmaine_0424 "Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring. " )
( charmaine_0425 "They do not know the length of time of incubation. " )
( charmaine_0426 "Enters now the psychology of the situation. " )
( charmaine_0427 "It was not exactly a deportation. " )
( charmaine_0428 "Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence. " )
( charmaine_0429 "Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance. " )
( charmaine_0430 "Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk. " )
( charmaine_0431 "The boy at the wheel lost his head. " )
( charmaine_0432 "To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo. " )
( charmaine_0433 "A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds. " )
( charmaine_0434 "What do you mean by this outrageous conduct. " )
( charmaine_0435 "But Martin smiled a superior smile. " )
( charmaine_0436 "By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell. " )
( charmaine_0437 "At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908. " )
( charmaine_0438 "At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908. " )
( charmaine_0439 "Yes, sir, I corrected. " )
( charmaine_0440 "Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me. " )
( charmaine_0441 "You live on an income which your father earned. " )
( charmaine_0442 "He was worth nothing to the world. " )
( charmaine_0443 "Then you don't believe in altruism. " )
( charmaine_0444 "The creative joy, I murmured. " )
( charmaine_0445 "He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument. " )
( charmaine_0446 "Ah, it is growing dark and darker. " )
( charmaine_0447 "I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost. " )
( charmaine_0448 "A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail. " )
( charmaine_0449 "No man ate of the seal meat or the oil. " )
( charmaine_0450 "I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand. " )
( charmaine_0451 "Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting. " )
( charmaine_0452 "Eighteen hundred, he calculated. " )
( charmaine_0453 "The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me. " )
( charmaine_0454 "I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him. " )
( charmaine_0455 "But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence. " )
( charmaine_0456 "What I saw I could not at first believe. " )
( charmaine_0457 "The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell. " )
( charmaine_0458 "There's too much of the schoolboy in me. " )
( charmaine_0459 "I had forgotten their existence. " )
( charmaine_0460 "Ah, we were very close together in that moment. " )
( charmaine_0461 "But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind. " )
( charmaine_0462 "They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate. " )
( charmaine_0463 "Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere. " )
( charmaine_0464 "He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage. " )
( charmaine_0465 "Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human. " )
( charmaine_0466 "And so early in the voyage, too. " )
( charmaine_0467 "In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius. " )
( charmaine_0468 "The eastern heavens were equally spectacular. " )
( charmaine_0469 "He spat it out like so much venom. " )
( charmaine_0470 "I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically. " )
( charmaine_0471 "He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure. " )
( charmaine_0472 "The night was calm and snowy. " )
( charmaine_0473 "I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born. " )
( charmaine_0474 "His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused. " )
( charmaine_0475 "At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder. " )
( charmaine_0476 "Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed. " )
( charmaine_0477 "Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room. " )
( charmaine_0478 "I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored. " )
( charmaine_0479 "Tom Spink has a harpoon. " )
( charmaine_0480 "Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness. " )
( charmaine_0481 "And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out. " )
( charmaine_0482 "Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes. " )
( charmaine_0483 "No-sir-ee. " )
( charmaine_0484 "Each insult added to the value of the claim. " )
( charmaine_0485 "For the rest, he was a mere automaton. " )
( charmaine_0486 "The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness. " )
( charmaine_0487 "Their love burned with increasing brightness. " )
( charmaine_0488 "They were artists, not biologists. " )
( charmaine_0489 "Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked. " )
( charmaine_0490 "And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied. " )
( charmaine_0491 "Burnt out like the crater of a volcano. " )
( charmaine_0492 "The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated. " )
( charmaine_0493 "O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm. " )
( charmaine_0494 "He bore no grudges and had few enemies. " )
( charmaine_0495 "And Tom King patiently endured. " )
( charmaine_0496 "King took every advantage he knew. " )
( charmaine_0497 "The lines were now very taut. " )
( charmaine_0498 "And right there I saw and knew it all. " )
( charmaine_0499 "Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury. " )
( charmaine_0500 "You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate. " )
( charmaine_0501 "Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai. " )
( charmaine_0502 "His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy. " )
( charmaine_0503 "He was an athlete and a giant. " )
( charmaine_0504 "We fished sharks on Niihau together. " )
( charmaine_0505 "The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu. " )
( charmaine_0506 "In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics. " )
( charmaine_0507 "Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity. " )
( charmaine_0508 "Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked. " )
( charmaine_0509 "Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment. " )
( charmaine_0510 "There is more behind this than a mere university ideal. " )
( charmaine_0511 "No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants. " )
( charmaine_0512 "We must give ourselves and not our money alone. " )
( charmaine_0513 "We are consumed in our own flesh-pots. " )
( charmaine_0514 "But here amongst ourselves let us speak out. " )
( charmaine_0515 "Also, there was awe in their faces. " )
( charmaine_0516 "Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it. " )
( charmaine_0517 "Illuminating oil was becoming all profit. " )
( charmaine_0518 "Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land. " )
( charmaine_0519 "He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem. " )
( charmaine_0520 "Without them he could not run his empire. " )
( charmaine_0521 "For such countries nothing remained but reorganization. " )
( charmaine_0522 "They could not continue their method of producing surpluses. " )
( charmaine_0523 "At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states. " )
( charmaine_0524 "The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work. " )
( charmaine_0525 "Nowhere did the raw earth appear. " )
( charmaine_0526 "The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield. " )
( charmaine_0527 "Men who endure it, call it living death. " )
( charmaine_0528 "As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly. " )
( charmaine_0529 "Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini. " )
( charmaine_0530 "In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining. " )
( charmaine_0531 "May drought destroy your crops. " )
( charmaine_0532 "Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse. " )
( charmaine_0533 "But Johannes could, and did. " )
( charmaine_0534 "A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem. " )
( charmaine_0535 "He would destroy all things that are fixed. " )
( charmaine_0536 "He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller. " )
( charmaine_0537 "What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived. " )
( charmaine_0538 "I should like to engage just for one whole life in that. " )
( charmaine_0539 "Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean. " )
( charmaine_0540 "The Warden with a quart of champagne. " )
( charmaine_0541 "Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements. " )
( charmaine_0542 "I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol. " )
( charmaine_0543 "He may anticipate the day of his death. " )
( charmaine_0544 "The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment. " )
( charmaine_0545 "I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze. " )
( charmaine_0546 "Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk. " )
( charmaine_0547 "Also, churches and preachers I had never known. " )
( charmaine_0548 "Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn. " )
( charmaine_0549 "This also became part of the daily schedule. " )
( charmaine_0550 "All an appearance can know is mirage. " )
( charmaine_0551 "Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly. " )
( charmaine_0552 "I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii. " )
( charmaine_0553 "Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu. " )
( charmaine_0554 "Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away. " )
( charmaine_0555 "Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already. " )
( charmaine_0556 "The last refugee had passed. " )
( charmaine_0557 "And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience. " )
( charmaine_0558 "Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord. " )
( charmaine_0559 "His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips. " )
( charmaine_0560 "Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation. " )
( charmaine_0561 "What the flaming. " )
( charmaine_0562 "Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap. " )
( charmaine_0563 "Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality. " )
( charmaine_0564 "With them were Indians, also three other men. " )
( charmaine_0565 "Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document. " )
( charmaine_0566 "Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet. " )
( charmaine_0567 "He was just bursting with joy, joy over what. " )
( charmaine_0568 "At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe. " )
( charmaine_0569 "Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia. " )
( charmaine_0570 "He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out. " )
( charmaine_0571 "I never saw anything like her in my life. " )
( charmaine_0572 "There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves. " )
( charmaine_0573 "Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying. " )
( charmaine_0574 "There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know. " )
( charmaine_0575 "And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers. " )
( charmaine_0576 "Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless. " )
( charmaine_0577 "But we'll just postpone this. " )
( charmaine_0578 "There was the Emma Louisa. " )
( charmaine_0579 "This is my fifth voyage. " )
( charmaine_0580 "It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind. " )
( charmaine_0581 "Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along. " )
( charmaine_0582 "Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake. " )
( charmaine_0583 "I have long noted your thirst unquenchable. " )
( charmaine_0584 "Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested. " )
( charmaine_0585 "We don't see ourselves as foolish. " )
( charmaine_0586 "He had comparatively no advantages at first. " )
( charmaine_0587 "He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions. " )
( charmaine_0588 "I was sick once -- typhoid. " )
( charmaine_0589 "In a way he is my protege. " )
( charmaine_0590 "We are both children together. " )
( charmaine_0591 "It's only his indigestion I find fault with. " )
( charmaine_0592 "She'd make a good wife for the cashier. " )
( charmaine_0593 "Gad, do I remember it. " )
( charmaine_0594 "You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl. " )
( charmaine_0595 "I can see that knife now. " )
( charmaine_0596 "When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die. " )
( charmaine_0597 "His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's. " )
( charmaine_0598 "He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door. " )
( charmaine_0599 "Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill. " )
( charmaine_0600 "Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile. " )
( charmaine_0601 "I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap. " )
( charmaine_0602 "He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger. " )
( charmaine_0603 "His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face. " )
( charmaine_0604 "Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him. " )
( charmaine_0605 "Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them. " )
( charmaine_0606 "Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout. " )
( charmaine_0607 "They robbed me a few years later. " )
( charmaine_0608 "He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it. " )
( charmaine_0609 "Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected. " )
( charmaine_0610 "I was completely lost in my work. " )
( charmaine_0611 "His slim hands gripped the edges of the table. " )
( charmaine_0612 "He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue. " )
( charmaine_0613 "Philip dropped back into his chair. " )
( charmaine_0614 "If I was out of the game it would be easily made. " )
( charmaine_0615 "MacDougall, my engineer, believes it. " )
( charmaine_0616 "It is growing, every day, every hour. " )
( charmaine_0617 "Now, you understand. " )
( charmaine_0618 "You have associated with some of these men. " )
( charmaine_0619 "And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight. " )
( charmaine_0620 "Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation. " )
( charmaine_0621 "All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto. " )
( charmaine_0622 "Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips. " )
( charmaine_0623 "Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil. " )
( charmaine_0624 "He caught himself with a jerk. " )
( charmaine_0625 "How does your wager look now. " )
( charmaine_0626 "He confessed that the sketch had startled him. " )
( charmaine_0627 "After all, the picture was only a resemblance. " )
( charmaine_0628 "He wondered, too, where Roscoe was. " )
( charmaine_0629 "Philip knew that she was not an Indian. " )
( charmaine_0630 "In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things. " )
( charmaine_0631 "Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him. " )
( charmaine_0632 "The thought set his blood tingling. " )
( charmaine_0633 "But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow. " )
( charmaine_0634 "Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief. " )
( charmaine_0635 "It won't be for sale. " )
( charmaine_0636 "For a few moments he ate in silence. " )
( charmaine_0637 "Philip did not pursue the subject. " )
( charmaine_0638 "Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him. " )
( charmaine_0639 "Suppose you saw me at work through the window. " )
( charmaine_0640 "He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two. " )
( charmaine_0641 "There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words. " )
( charmaine_0642 "All this day Gregson remained in the cabin. " )
( charmaine_0643 "The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson. " )
( charmaine_0644 "The flush was gone from her face. " )
( charmaine_0645 "That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed. " )
( charmaine_0646 "He understood the meaning of the look. " )
( charmaine_0647 "She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before. " )
( charmaine_0648 "I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson. " )
( charmaine_0649 "They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers. " )
( charmaine_0650 "We must achieve our own salvation. " )
( charmaine_0651 "In moments of mental energy Philip was restless. " )
( charmaine_0652 "He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two. " )
( charmaine_0653 "Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence. " )
( charmaine_0654 "Now it was missing from the wall. " )
( charmaine_0655 "He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait. " )
( charmaine_0656 "I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight. " )
( charmaine_0657 "Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip. " )
( charmaine_0658 "If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen. " )
( charmaine_0659 "Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight. " )
( charmaine_0660 "Only the chance sound had led him to observe them. " )
( charmaine_0661 "Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre. " )
( charmaine_0662 "There was no chance to fire without hitting him. " )
( charmaine_0663 "There was no answer from the other side. " )
( charmaine_0664 "Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him. " )
( charmaine_0665 "With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone. " )
( charmaine_0666 "Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive. " )
( charmaine_0667 "In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution. " )
( charmaine_0668 "Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him. " )
( charmaine_0669 "It is the nearest refuge. " )
( charmaine_0670 "There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice. " )
( charmaine_0671 "The truth of it set Jeanne quivering. " )
( charmaine_0672 "Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon. " )
( charmaine_0673 "You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock. " )
( charmaine_0674 "He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break. " )
( charmaine_0675 "In it there was something that was almost tragedy. " )
( charmaine_0676 "Your face is red with blood. " )
( charmaine_0677 "Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank. " )
( charmaine_0678 "He can care for himself. " )
( charmaine_0679 "They will search for us between their camp and Churchill. " )
( charmaine_0680 "Until I die, he exclaimed. " )
( charmaine_0681 "Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils. " )
( charmaine_0682 "The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed. " )
( charmaine_0683 "For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking. " )
( charmaine_0684 "I want to die in it. " )
( charmaine_0685 "Darkness hid him from Jeanne. " )
( charmaine_0686 "And yet if she came he had no words to say. " )
( charmaine_0687 "He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day. " )
( charmaine_0688 "Within himself he called it no longer his own. " )
( charmaine_0689 "Besides, that noise makes me deaf. " )
( charmaine_0690 "Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe. " )
( charmaine_0691 "Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks. " )
( charmaine_0692 "There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne. " )
( charmaine_0693 "You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win. " )
( charmaine_0694 "I'll only be in the way. " )
( charmaine_0695 "He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips. " )
( charmaine_0696 "Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body. " )
( charmaine_0697 "I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows. " )
( charmaine_0698 "For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face. " )
( charmaine_0699 "He was sure, now, of but few things. " )
( charmaine_0700 "It was a miracle, and I owe you my life. " )
( charmaine_0701 "Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him. " )
( charmaine_0702 "Such men believe, when they come together. " )
( charmaine_0703 "The journey was continued at dawn. " )
( charmaine_0704 "Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock. " )
( charmaine_0705 "There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now. " )
( charmaine_0706 "He moved his position, and the illusion was gone. " )
( charmaine_0707 "For two hours not a word passed between them. " )
( charmaine_0708 "I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip. " )
( charmaine_0709 "That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer. " )
( charmaine_0710 "We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call. " )
( charmaine_0711 "Billinger may arrive in time. " )
( charmaine_0712 "There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette. " )
( charmaine_0713 "I want my men to work by themselves. " )
( charmaine_0714 "Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe. " )
( charmaine_0715 "Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men. " )
( charmaine_0716 "Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times. " )
( charmaine_0717 "It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear. " )
( charmaine_0718 "Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast. " )
( charmaine_0719 "He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman. " )
( charmaine_0720 "Philip bent low over Pierre. " )
( charmaine_0721 "Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill. " )
( charmaine_0722 "She saw the answer in his face. " )
( charmaine_0723 "Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you. " )
( charmaine_0724 "There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand. " )
( charmaine_0725 "There followed a roar that shook the earth. " )
( charmaine_0726 "Blind with rage, he darted in. " )
( charmaine_0727 "In it was the joy of life. " )
( charmaine_0728 "Swiftly his eyes measured the situation. " )
( charmaine_0729 "But this little defect did not worry him. " )
( charmaine_0730 "And then, steadily, he began to chew. " )
( charmaine_0731 "Together they ate the rabbit. " )
( charmaine_0732 "They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world. " )
( charmaine_0733 "It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits. " )
( charmaine_0734 "Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now. " )
( charmaine_0735 "It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it. " )
( charmaine_0736 "But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart. " )
( charmaine_0737 "Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest. " )
( charmaine_0738 "After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment. " )
( charmaine_0739 "Had it struck squarely it would have killed him. " )
( charmaine_0740 "The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce. " )
( charmaine_0741 "Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur. " )
( charmaine_0742 "And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear. " )
( charmaine_0743 "It was steel, a fisher trap. " )
( charmaine_0744 "OW, a wild dog, he growled. " )
( charmaine_0745 "He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home. " )
( charmaine_0746 "That is the strange part of it. " )
( charmaine_0747 "His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor. " )
( charmaine_0748 "For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight. " )
( charmaine_0749 "In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle. " )
( charmaine_0750 "She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms. " )
( charmaine_0751 "His teeth shut with a last click. " )
( charmaine_0752 "It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators. " )
( charmaine_0753 "In a flash he was on his feet, facing him. " )
( charmaine_0754 "He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders. " )
( charmaine_0755 "The moon had already begun its westward decline. " )
( charmaine_0756 "They laughed like two happy children. " )
( charmaine_0757 "He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back. " )
( charmaine_0758 "Fast, but endure. " )
( charmaine_0759 "A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came. " )
( charmaine_0760 "The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart. " )
( charmaine_0761 "He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them. " )
( charmaine_0762 "Then he shouted, Shut up. " )
( charmaine_0763 "He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair. " )
( charmaine_0764 "On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded. " )
( charmaine_0765 "To these he gave castor oil. " )
( charmaine_0766 "Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing. " )
( charmaine_0767 "Sheldon glanced at the thermometer. " )
( charmaine_0768 "I'll see to poor Hughie. " )
( charmaine_0769 "Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering. " )
( charmaine_0770 "Also, I want information. " )
( charmaine_0771 "Let them go out and eat with my boys. " )
( charmaine_0772 "I, I beg pardon, he drawled. " )
( charmaine_0773 "And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt. " )
( charmaine_0774 "I was in New York when the crash came. " )
( charmaine_0775 "No, I did not fall among thieves. " )
( charmaine_0776 "Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips. " )
( charmaine_0777 "Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me. " )
( charmaine_0778 "I can't go elsewhere, by your own account. " )
( charmaine_0779 "Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation. " )
( charmaine_0780 "He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips. " )
( charmaine_0781 "That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals. " )
( charmaine_0782 "Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off. " )
( charmaine_0783 "He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons. " )
( charmaine_0784 "Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged. " )
( charmaine_0785 "So was Packard's finish suicide. " )
( charmaine_0786 "Joan cried, with shining eyes. " )
( charmaine_0787 "Nobody knows how the natives got them. " )
( charmaine_0788 "How can you manage all alone, Mr Young. " )
( charmaine_0789 "The planters are already considering the matter. " )
( charmaine_0790 "I use great trouble advisedly. " )
( charmaine_0791 "Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time. " )
( charmaine_0792 "We leave the eventuality to time and law. " )
( charmaine_0793 "I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe. " )
( charmaine_0794 "Society is shaken to its foundations. " )
( charmaine_0795 "A month in Australia would finish me. " )
( charmaine_0796 "Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods. " )
( charmaine_0797 "You were destroying my life. " )
( charmaine_0798 "Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery. " )
( charmaine_0799 "I'm as good as a man, she urged. " )
( charmaine_0800 "You read the quotations in today's paper. " )
( charmaine_0801 "He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them. " )
( charmaine_0802 "Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi. " )
( charmaine_0803 "This is eighteen eighty. " )
( charmaine_0804 "Death is and has been ever since old Maui died. " )
( charmaine_0805 "Some boy, she laughed acquiescence. " )
( charmaine_0806 "Let us talk it over and find a way out. " )
( charmaine_0807 "It is a good property, and worth more than that. " )
( charmaine_0808 "I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted. " )
( charmaine_0809 "Such is my passage engaged on the steamer. " )
( charmaine_0810 "The issue was not in doubt. " )
( charmaine_0811 "Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all. " )
( charmaine_0812 "Harry Bancroft, Dave lied. " )
( charmaine_0813 "It's a Yankee, Joan cried. " )
( charmaine_0814 "He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant. " )
( charmaine_0815 "They likewise are disinclined to being eaten. " )
( charmaine_0816 "But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta. " )
( charmaine_0817 "The President of the United States was his friend. " )
( charmaine_0818 "Your face was the personification of duplicity. " )
( charmaine_0819 "Shorty turned to their employers. " )
( charmaine_0820 "You were engaged. " )
( charmaine_0821 "I saw it all myself, and it was splendid. " )
( charmaine_0822 "Now run along, and tell them to hurry. " )
( charmaine_0823 "What's that grub-thief got to do with it. " )
( charmaine_0824 "It was a superb picture. " )
( charmaine_0825 "So she said, the irate skipper dashed on. " )
( charmaine_0826 "And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice. " )
( charmaine_0827 "Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard. " )
( charmaine_0828 "Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land. " )
( charmaine_0829 "They just lay off in the bush and plugged away. " )
( charmaine_0830 "The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating. " )
( charmaine_0831 "And there was a dog that barked. " )
( charmaine_0832 "There are four, all low, McCoy answered. " )
( charmaine_0833 "The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley. " )
( charmaine_0834 "The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand. " )
( charmaine_0835 "They had been on the same lay as ourselves. " )
( charmaine_0836 "You are positively soulless, he said savagely. " )
( charmaine_0837 "Harrison is still my chauffeur. " )
( charmaine_0838 "The boy grew and prospered. " )
( charmaine_0839 "He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone. " )
( charmaine_0840 "Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol. " )
( charmaine_0841 "I know they are my oysters. " )
( charmaine_0842 "By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek. " )
( charmaine_0843 "They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents. " )
( charmaine_0844 "It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne. " )
( charmaine_0845 "The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds. " )
( charmaine_0846 "At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders. " )
( charmaine_0847 "Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him. " )
( charmaine_0848 "Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect. " )
( charmaine_0849 "Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust. " )
( charmaine_0850 "You fired me out of your house, in short. " )
( charmaine_0851 "Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh. " )
( charmaine_0852 "It's worth eight dollars. " )
( charmaine_0853 "And he did hurt my arm. " )
( charmaine_0854 "Saxon's onto her job. " )
( charmaine_0855 "Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another. " )
( charmaine_0856 "But this time it was Saxon who rebelled. " )
( charmaine_0857 "I was not to cry out in the face of fear. " )
( charmaine_0858 "And now put yourself in my place for a moment. " )
( charmaine_0859 "The boy threw back his head with pride. " )
( charmaine_0860 "Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned. " )
( charmaine_0861 "Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot. " )
( charmaine_0862 "We could throw stones with our feet. " )
( charmaine_0863 "It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way. " )
( charmaine_0864 "These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter. " )
( charmaine_0865 "Then it was that a strange thing happened. " )
( charmaine_0866 "From the source of light a harsh voice said. " )
( charmaine_0867 "But I did not enjoy it long. " )
( charmaine_0868 "We were now good friends. " )
( charmaine_0869 "Two of the Folk were already up. " )
( charmaine_0870 "Now animals do not like mockery. " )
( charmaine_0871 "He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees. " )
( charmaine_0872 "Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried. " )
( charmaine_0873 "Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion. " )
( charmaine_0874 "Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured. " )
( charmaine_0875 "But we were without this momentum. " )
( charmaine_0876 "There was one difficulty, however. " )
( charmaine_0877 "The hyena proceeded to dine. " )
( charmaine_0878 "The time was considered auspicious. " )
( charmaine_0879 "Or have they already devised one. " )
( charmaine_0880 "We would not spend another such night. " )
( charmaine_0881 "At first his progress was slow and erratic. " )
( charmaine_0882 "He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated. " )
( charmaine_0883 "The awe of man rushed over him again. " )
( charmaine_0884 "The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders. " )
( charmaine_0885 "Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities. " )
( charmaine_0886 "For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched. " )
( charmaine_0887 "All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret. " )
( charmaine_0888 "At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style. " )
( charmaine_0889 "Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round. " )
( charmaine_0890 "His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck. " )
( charmaine_0891 "Miss Brodie's smile was slightly sarcastic. " )
( charmaine_0892 "Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way. " )
( charmaine_0893 "A flying arrow passed between us. " )
( charmaine_0894 "I pulled, suddenly, with all my might. " )
( charmaine_0895 "Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work. " )
( charmaine_0896 "His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children. " )
( charmaine_0897 "It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp. " )
( charmaine_0898 "Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers. " )
( charmaine_0899 "We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters. " )
( charmaine_0900 "We never made another migration. " )
( charmaine_0901 "Nor was Elam Harnish an exception. " )
( charmaine_0902 "A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor. " )
( charmaine_0903 "The 29th very foggy. " )
( charmaine_0904 "Dig in; you're sure good, was Daylight's answer. " )
( charmaine_0905 "The apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt. " )
( charmaine_0906 "He had been born with this endowment. " )
( charmaine_0907 "And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal. " )
( charmaine_0908 "Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun. " )
( charmaine_0909 "He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury. " )
( charmaine_0910 "Again he had done the big thing. " )
( charmaine_0911 "Daylight was tired, profoundly tired. " )
( charmaine_0912 "The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter. " )
( charmaine_0913 "Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day. " )
( charmaine_0914 "Their supply of grub was gone. " )
( charmaine_0915 "Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead. " )
( charmaine_0916 "Not till the twentieth of May did the river break. " )
( charmaine_0917 "It was a gigantic inadequacy. " )
( charmaine_0918 "Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel. " )
( charmaine_0919 "He had been so easy. " )
( charmaine_0920 "Change chairs, Daylight commanded. " )
( charmaine_0921 "I'd sooner have my chips back. " )
( charmaine_0922 "They only had a little thirty thousand dollar fire. " )
( charmaine_0923 "His partners had starved and died on the Stewart. " )
( charmaine_0924 "As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all. " )
( charmaine_0925 "It does, was her audacious answer. " )
( charmaine_0926 "Oh, it's just a novel, a love story. " )
( charmaine_0927 "Whoever lived on the ranch did that. " )
( charmaine_0928 "How old are you, mother. " )
( charmaine_0929 "Here he got a fresh thrill. " )
( charmaine_0930 "It was unobtrusive, yet it was there. " )
( charmaine_0931 "Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned. " )
( charmaine_0932 "These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him. " )
( charmaine_0933 "I play that choice wide open to win. " )
( charmaine_0934 "Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up. " )
( charmaine_0935 "But how are you going to do it. " )
( charmaine_0936 "Lots of men take women buggy riding. " )
( charmaine_0937 "Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him. " )
( charmaine_0938 "There's not an iota of truth in it. " )
( charmaine_0939 "But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano. " )
( charmaine_0940 "Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me. " )
( charmaine_0941 "In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell. " )
( charmaine_0942 "Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest. " )
( charmaine_0943 "Matthewson, who's this bookkeeper, Rogers. " )
( charmaine_0944 "Now just what do you want to know. " )
( charmaine_0945 "I want to know how all this is possible. " )
( charmaine_0946 "It's that much junk. " )
( charmaine_0947 "There was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed. " )
( charmaine_0948 "He loved to play Chinese lottery. " )
( charmaine_0949 "The Law of Club and Fang " )
( charmaine_0950 "The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip. " )
( charmaine_0951 "And as never before, he was ready to obey. " )
( charmaine_0952 "This state of mind comes of an undue prominence of the ego. " )
( charmaine_0953 "There are the canals of China, and the Yang-tse River. " )
( charmaine_0954 "We threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed. " )
( charmaine_0955 "She was built primarily to sail. " )
( charmaine_0956 "In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco there are some crack sailors. " )
( charmaine_0957 "My age, in years, is twenty two. " )
( charmaine_0958 "I forgot how easily I had taught myself from the printed page. " )
( charmaine_0959 "Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week. " )
( charmaine_0960 "Please do not think that I already know it all. " )
( charmaine_0961 "You see, we were teaching ourselves. " )
( charmaine_0962 "And now behold the perversity of things. " )
( charmaine_0963 "Yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you. " )
( charmaine_0964 "Mr McVeigh told me about him. " )
( charmaine_0965 "Unlike Joshua, he stood in no need of divine assistance. " )
( charmaine_0966 "To say the least, Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist. " )
( charmaine_0967 "Man could not conquer them. " )
( charmaine_0968 "Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved. " )
( charmaine_0969 "A scarlet loincloth completed his costume. " )
( charmaine_0970 "I like to speculate upon the glorious future of man. " )
( charmaine_0971 "Christmas is an easy problem compared with a Polynesian giving-feast. " )
( charmaine_0972 "He had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it. " )
( charmaine_0973 "And how would we ever find ourselves. " )
( charmaine_0974 "I defy any man to get a Solomon Island sore in California. " )
( charmaine_0975 "A bush chief had died a natural death. " )
( charmaine_0976 "The skipper's and Nakata's gymnastics served as a translation without words. " )
( charmaine_0977 "Last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia. " )
( charmaine_0978 "My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives. " )
( charmaine_0979 "It is merely the simple superlative. " )
( charmaine_0980 "I made no more overtures. " )
( charmaine_0981 "Among my minor afflictions, I may mention a new and mysterious one. " )
( charmaine_0982 "The voyage was our idea of a good time. " )
( charmaine_0983 "At sea, Tuesday, March 17, 1908. " )
( charmaine_0984 "Yes, sir, he answered, with cheerful alacrity. " )
( charmaine_0985 "I was still weak from my prolonged immersion. " )
( charmaine_0986 "The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper. " )
( charmaine_0987 "I was beneath the water, suffocating and drowning. " )
( charmaine_0988 "The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing. " )
( charmaine_0989 "The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed. " )
( charmaine_0990 "I have been robbed, sir, I amended. " )
( charmaine_0991 "You were looking squeamish this afternoon, he began. " )
( charmaine_0992 "How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment. " )
( charmaine_0993 "I learned it myself in English ships. " )
( charmaine_0994 "An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others. " )
( charmaine_0995 "Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding. " )
( charmaine_0996 "Yes, and no, sir, was the slow reply. " )
( charmaine_0997 "And each year something happened, and I did not go. " )
( charmaine_0998 "How in hell did he know it was you in the dark. " )
( charmaine_0999 "Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually occurring. " )
( charmaine_1000 "You have all the advantage. " )
( charmaine_1001 "The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip. " )
( charmaine_1002 "Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour. " )
( charmaine_1003 "He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough. " )
( charmaine_1004 "Ah, it was sweet in my ears. " )
( charmaine_1005 "He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy pleasure. " )
( charmaine_1006 "It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore. " )
( charmaine_1007 "There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean. " )
( charmaine_1008 "I arose obediently and went down the beach. " )
( charmaine_1009 "The next thing to watch out for is bed sores. " )
( charmaine_1010 "At that moment I got the impression that she was willowy. " )
( charmaine_1011 "Your father's fifth command, he nodded. " )
( charmaine_1012 "On occasion, on this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised. " )
( charmaine_1013 "She is essentially the life-giving, life-conserving female of the species. " )
( charmaine_1014 "This was when the explosion occurred. " )
( charmaine_1015 "Also, at regular intervals, he would mutter. " )
( charmaine_1016 "It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear looking into. " )
( charmaine_1017 "There were orange-green, gold-green, and a copper-green. " )
( charmaine_1018 "The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out. " )
( charmaine_1019 "The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the Argentine. " )
( charmaine_1020 "The history of our westward-faring race is written in it. " )
