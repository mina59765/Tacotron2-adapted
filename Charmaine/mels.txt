Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0001.pt|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0002.pt|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0003.pt|Lord, but Im glad to see you again, Phil. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0004.pt|Will we ever forget it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0005.pt|God bless em, I hope Ill go on seeing them forever. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0006.pt|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0007.pt|Gad, your letter came just in time. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0008.pt|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0009.pt|Im playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0010.pt|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0011.pt|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0012.pt|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0013.pt|Now youre coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0014.pt|Its the aurora borealis. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0015.pt|Theres Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0016.pt|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0017.pt|There was a change now. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0018.pt|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0019.pt|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0020.pt|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0021.pt|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0022.pt|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0023.pt|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0024.pt|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0025.pt|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0026.pt|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0027.pt|Robbery, bribery, fraud,  
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0028.pt|Their forces were already moving into the north country. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0029.pt|I had faith in them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0030.pt|They were three hundred yards apart. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0031.pt|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0032.pt|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0033.pt|Men of Seldens stamp dont stop at women and children. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0034.pt|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0035.pt|She turned in at the hotel. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0036.pt|I was the only one who remained sitting. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0037.pt|Well have to watch our chances. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0038.pt|The ship should be in within a week or ten days. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0039.pt|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0040.pt|Meanwhile Ill go out to breathe a spell. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0041.pt|How could he explain his possession of the sketch. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0042.pt|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0043.pt|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0044.pt|He moved away as quietly as he had come. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0045.pt|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0046.pt|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0047.pt|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0048.pt|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0049.pt|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0050.pt|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0051.pt|It was a curious coincidence. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0052.pt|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0053.pt|There was nothing on the rock. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0054.pt|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0055.pt|Pearces little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0056.pt|I have no idea, replied Philip. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0057.pt|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0058.pt|His immaculate appearance was gone. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0059.pt|Anyway, no one saw her like that. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0060.pt|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0061.pt|The men stared into each others face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0062.pt|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0063.pt|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0064.pt|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0065.pt|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0066.pt|Surely I will excuse you, she cried. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0067.pt|In a flash Philip followed its direction. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0068.pt|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0069.pt|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0070.pt|What was the object of your little sensation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0071.pt|But who was Eileens double. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0072.pt|The promoters eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0073.pt|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0074.pt|There has been a change, she interrupted him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0075.pt|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0076.pt|It is the fire, partly, she said. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0077.pt|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0078.pt|It was a large canoe. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0079.pt|What if Jeanne failed him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0080.pt|What if she did not come to the rock. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0081.pt|His face was streaming with blood. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0082.pt|A shadow was creeping over Pierres eyes. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0083.pt|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierres closing eyes shot open. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0084.pt|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0085.pt|Death had come with terrible suddenness. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0086.pt|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0087.pt|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0088.pt|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0089.pt|The singing voice approached rapidly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0090.pt|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0091.pt|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0092.pt|For a full minute he crouched and listened. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0093.pt|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0094.pt|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0095.pt|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0096.pt|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0097.pt|Shall I carry you. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0098.pt|A maddening joy pounded in his brain. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0099.pt|You must sleep, he urged. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0100.pt|You, you would not keep the truth from me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0101.pt|He will follow us soon. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0102.pt|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0103.pt|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0104.pt|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0105.pt|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0106.pt|If you only could know how I thank you. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0107.pt|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0108.pt|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0109.pt|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0110.pt|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0111.pt|He was wounded in the arm. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0112.pt|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0113.pt|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0114.pt|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0115.pt|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0116.pt|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0117.pt|Pierre obeys me when we are together. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0118.pt|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0119.pt|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0120.pt|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0121.pt|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0122.pt|She had died from cold and starvation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0123.pt|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0124.pt|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0125.pt|Each day she became a more vital part of him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0126.pt|It was a temptation, but he resisted it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0127.pt|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0128.pt|Her face was against his breast. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0129.pt|She was his now, forever. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0130.pt|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0131.pt|A cry of joy burst from Philips lips. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0132.pt|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0133.pt|He obeyed the pressure of her hand. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0134.pt|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0135.pt|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0136.pt|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0137.pt|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0138.pt|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0139.pt|Accept a fathers blessing, and with it, this. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0140.pt|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0141.pt|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0142.pt|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0143.pt|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0144.pt|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0145.pt|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0146.pt|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0147.pt|Now these things had been struck dead within him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0148.pt|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0149.pt|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0150.pt|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0151.pt|Philip thrust himself against it and entered. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0152.pt|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0153.pt|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0154.pt|Wont you draw up, gentlemen. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0155.pt|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0156.pt|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0157.pt|Does that look good. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0158.pt|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0159.pt|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0160.pt|Take away their foreman and they wouldnt be worth their grub. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0161.pt|Thats the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0162.pt|Philip made no effort to follow. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0163.pt|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0164.pt|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0165.pt|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her fathers men were hiding. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0166.pt|I was near the cabin, and saw you. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0167.pt|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0168.pt|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0169.pt|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0170.pt|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0171.pt|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0172.pt|The date was nearly eighteen years old. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0173.pt|They were the presage of storm. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0174.pt|Down there the earth was already swelling with life. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0175.pt|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0176.pt|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0177.pt|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0178.pt|Tomorrow Im going after that bear, he said. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0179.pt|If not, lets say our prayers and go to bed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0180.pt|So cheer up, and give us your paw. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0181.pt|This time he did not yap for mercy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0182.pt|And the air was growing chilly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0183.pt|Dont you see, Im chewing this thing in two. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0184.pt|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0185.pt|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0186.pt|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0187.pt|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0188.pt|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0189.pt|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0190.pt|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0191.pt|He did not rush in. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0192.pt|It was edged with ice. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0193.pt|He drank of the water cautiously. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0194.pt|But a strange thing happened. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0195.pt|He began to follow the footprints of the dog. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0196.pt|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0197.pt|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0198.pt|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0199.pt|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0200.pt|He cried, and swung the club wildly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0201.pt|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0202.pt|They were following the shore of a lake. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0203.pt|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0204.pt|From now on were pals. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0205.pt|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0206.pt|How much was it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0207.pt|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0208.pt|It was not a large lake, and almost round. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0209.pt|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0210.pt|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0211.pt|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0212.pt|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0213.pt|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0214.pt|They die out of spite. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0215.pt|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0216.pt|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0217.pt|The ringing of the big bell aroused him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0218.pt|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0219.pt|A dead man is of no use on a plantation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0220.pt|I dont know why youre here at all. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0221.pt|What part of the United States is your home. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0222.pt|My, Im almost homesick for it already. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0223.pt|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0224.pt|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0225.pt|That came before my A B Cs. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0226.pt|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0227.pt|But it contributed to the smash. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0228.pt|The last one I knew was an overseer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0229.pt|Do you know any good land around here. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0230.pt|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0231.pt|I cannot follow you, she said. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0232.pt|I never allow what cant be changed to annoy me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0233.pt|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0234.pt|His voice was passionately rebellious. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0235.pt|Dont you see I hate you. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0236.pt|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0237.pt|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0238.pt|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0239.pt|Wash your hands of me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0240.pt|I think its much nicer to quarrel. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0241.pt|I saw it when she rolled. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0242.pt|I only read the quotations. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0243.pt|He was the soul of devotion to his employers. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0244.pt|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0245.pt|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0246.pt|They ought to pass here some time today. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0247.pt|I had been sad too long already. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0248.pt|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0249.pt|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0250.pt|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0251.pt|OBrien had been a clean living young man with ideals. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0252.pt|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0253.pt|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0254.pt|You wont die of malnutrition, be sure of that. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0255.pt|See the length of the body and that elongated neck. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0256.pt|They are coming ashore, whoever they are. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0257.pt|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0258.pt|Think of investing in such an adventure. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0259.pt|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0260.pt|I have been doubly baptized. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0261.pt|They wouldnt be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0262.pt|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0263.pt|And I hope youve got plenty of chain out, Captain Young. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0264.pt|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0265.pt|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0266.pt|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0267.pt|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0268.pt|Thats where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0269.pt|And after the bath a shave would not be bad. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0270.pt|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0271.pt|You can take a vacation on pay. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0272.pt|They are big trees and require plenty of room. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0273.pt|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0274.pt|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0275.pt|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0276.pt|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0277.pt|It would give me nervous prostration. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0278.pt|She said with chattering teeth. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0279.pt|Ill be out of my head in fifteen minutes. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0280.pt|I do not blame you for anything; remember that. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0281.pt|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0282.pt|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0283.pt|There was no forecasting this strange girls processes. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0284.pt|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0285.pt|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0286.pt|Keep an eye on him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0287.pt|Those are my oysters, he said at last. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0288.pt|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0289.pt|One by one the boys were captured. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0290.pt|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0291.pt|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0292.pt|They were deep in the primeval forest. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0293.pt|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0294.pt|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0295.pt|Bassett was a fastidious man. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0296.pt|Theres a big English general right now whose name is Roberts. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0297.pt|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0298.pt|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0299.pt|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0300.pt|But all my dreams violated this law. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0301.pt|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0302.pt|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0303.pt|I graduated last of my class. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0304.pt|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0305.pt|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0306.pt|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0307.pt|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0308.pt|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0309.pt|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0310.pt|Therefore, hurrah for the game. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0311.pt|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0312.pt|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0313.pt|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0314.pt|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0315.pt|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0316.pt|He was a wise hyena. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0317.pt|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0318.pt|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0319.pt|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eyes face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0320.pt|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0321.pt|This is a common experience with all of us. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0322.pt|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0323.pt|It was not Red-Eyes way to forego revenge so easily. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0324.pt|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0325.pt|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0326.pt|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0327.pt|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0328.pt|Ah, indeed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0329.pt|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0330.pt|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0331.pt|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0332.pt|This is no place for you. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0333.pt|Hell knock you off a few sticks in no time. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0334.pt|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0335.pt|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0336.pt|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0337.pt|The fighting had now become intermittent. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0338.pt|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0339.pt|It was like the beating of hoofs. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0340.pt|Why, doggone you all, shake again. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0341.pt|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0342.pt|You mean for this State, General, Alberta. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0343.pt|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0344.pt|She was trying to pass the apron string around him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0345.pt|Get down and dig in. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0346.pt|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0347.pt|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0348.pt|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0349.pt|Is that Pat Hanrahans mug looking hungry and willing. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0350.pt|It was more like sugar. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0351.pt|Im sure going along with you all, Elijah. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0352.pt|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0353.pt|Fresh meat they failed to obtain. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0354.pt|A burst of laughter was his reward. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0355.pt|You dont catch me at any such foolishness. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0356.pt|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0357.pt|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0358.pt|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0359.pt|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0360.pt|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0361.pt|Nope, not the slightest idea. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0362.pt|It is not an attempt to smash the market. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0363.pt|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0364.pt|These rumors may even originate with us. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0365.pt|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0366.pt|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0367.pt|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0368.pt|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0369.pt|He saw all men in the business game doing this. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0370.pt|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0371.pt|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0372.pt|Points of view, new ideas, life. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0373.pt|But lifes worth more than cash, she argued. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0374.pt|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0375.pt|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0376.pt|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0377.pt|Thats why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0378.pt|How old are you, daddy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0379.pt|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0380.pt|My names Ferguson. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0381.pt|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0382.pt|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0383.pt|The farmer works the soil and produces grain. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0384.pt|Thats what Carnegie did. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0385.pt|I cant argue with you, and you know that. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0386.pt|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0387.pt|It was my idea to a tee. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0388.pt|Mab, she said. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0389.pt|Ill go over tomorrow afternoon. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0390.pt|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0391.pt|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0392.pt|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0393.pt|Its the strap hangers thatll keep us from going under. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0394.pt|As for himself, werent the street railway earnings increasing steadily. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0395.pt|A rising tide of fat had submerged them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0396.pt|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0397.pt|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0398.pt|And heres another idea. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0399.pt|Manuel had one besetting sin. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0400.pt|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0401.pt|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0402.pt|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0403.pt|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0404.pt|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0405.pt|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0406.pt|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0407.pt|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0408.pt|He could feel a new stir in the land. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0409.pt|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0410.pt|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0411.pt|There is another virtue in these bulkheads. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0412.pt|But I am at the end of my resources. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0413.pt|Now our figuring was all right. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0414.pt|It lasted as a deterrent for two days. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0415.pt|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0416.pt|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0417.pt|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0418.pt|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0419.pt|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0420.pt|By golly, the boy wins. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0421.pt|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0422.pt|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0423.pt|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0424.pt|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0425.pt|They do not know the length of time of incubation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0426.pt|Enters now the psychology of the situation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0427.pt|It was not exactly a deportation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0428.pt|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0429.pt|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0430.pt|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0431.pt|The boy at the wheel lost his head. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0432.pt|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0433.pt|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0434.pt|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0435.pt|But Martin smiled a superior smile. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0436.pt|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0437.pt|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0438.pt|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0439.pt|Yes, sir, I corrected. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0440.pt|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0441.pt|You live on an income which your father earned. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0442.pt|He was worth nothing to the world. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0443.pt|Then you dont believe in altruism. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0444.pt|The creative joy, I murmured. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0445.pt|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0446.pt|Ah, it is growing dark and darker. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0447.pt|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0448.pt|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0449.pt|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0450.pt|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoots left hand. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0451.pt|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0452.pt|Eighteen hundred, he calculated. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0453.pt|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0454.pt|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0455.pt|But it wont continue, she said with easy confidence. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0456.pt|What I saw I could not at first believe. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0457.pt|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0458.pt|Theres too much of the schoolboy in me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0459.pt|I had forgotten their existence. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0460.pt|Ah, we were very close together in that moment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0461.pt|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0462.pt|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0463.pt|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0464.pt|Hell never do a tap of work the whole Voyage. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0465.pt|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0466.pt|And so early in the voyage, too. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0467.pt|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0468.pt|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0469.pt|He spat it out like so much venom. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0470.pt|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0471.pt|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0472.pt|The night was calm and snowy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0473.pt|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0474.pt|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0475.pt|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0476.pt|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0477.pt|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0478.pt|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0479.pt|Tom Spink has a harpoon. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0480.pt|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0481.pt|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0482.pt|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0483.pt|No-sir-ee. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0484.pt|Each insult added to the value of the claim. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0485.pt|For the rest, he was a mere automaton. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0486.pt|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0487.pt|Their love burned with increasing brightness. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0488.pt|They were artists, not biologists. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0489.pt|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0490.pt|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0491.pt|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0492.pt|The boy, OBrien, was specially maltreated. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0493.pt|OBrien took off his coat and bared his right arm. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0494.pt|He bore no grudges and had few enemies. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0495.pt|And Tom King patiently endured. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0496.pt|King took every advantage he knew. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0497.pt|The lines were now very taut. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0498.pt|And right there I saw and knew it all. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0499.pt|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0500.pt|Youre joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0501.pt|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0502.pt|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0503.pt|He was an athlete and a giant. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0504.pt|We fished sharks on Niihau together. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0505.pt|The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0506.pt|In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0507.pt|Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0508.pt|Yet, in accordance with Ernests test of truth, it worked. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0509.pt|Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0510.pt|There is more behind this than a mere university ideal. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0511.pt|No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0512.pt|We must give ourselves and not our money alone. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0513.pt|We are consumed in our own flesh-pots. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0514.pt|But here amongst ourselves let us speak out. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0515.pt|Also, there was awe in their faces. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0516.pt|Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0517.pt|Illuminating oil was becoming all profit. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0518.pt|Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0519.pt|He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0520.pt|Without them he could not run his empire. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0521.pt|For such countries nothing remained but reorganization. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0522.pt|They could not continue their method of producing surpluses. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0523.pt|At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0524.pt|The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0525.pt|Nowhere did the raw earth appear. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0526.pt|The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0527.pt|Men who endure it, call it living death. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0528.pt|As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0529.pt|Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0530.pt|In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0531.pt|May drought destroy your crops. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0532.pt|Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0533.pt|But Johannes could, and did. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0534.pt|A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0535.pt|He would destroy all things that are fixed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0536.pt|He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0537.pt|What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0538.pt|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0539.pt|Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0540.pt|The Warden with a quart of champagne. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0541.pt|Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0542.pt|I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0543.pt|He may anticipate the day of his death. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0544.pt|The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0545.pt|I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0546.pt|Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0547.pt|Also, churches and preachers I had never known. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0548.pt|Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0549.pt|This also became part of the daily schedule. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0550.pt|All an appearance can know is mirage. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0551.pt|Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0552.pt|I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0553.pt|Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0554.pt|Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0555.pt|Why, hes bought forty pounds of goods from you already. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0556.pt|The last refugee had passed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0557.pt|And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0558.pt|Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0559.pt|His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0560.pt|Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0561.pt|What the flaming. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0562.pt|Mrs McFees jaws brought together with a snap. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0563.pt|Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0564.pt|With them were Indians, also three other men. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0565.pt|Dennins hands were released long enough for him to sign the document. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0566.pt|Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0567.pt|He was just bursting with joy, joy over what. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0568.pt|At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0569.pt|Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0570.pt|He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0571.pt|I never saw anything like her in my life. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0572.pt|There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0573.pt|Good business man, Curly, OBrien was saying. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0574.pt|There werent any missions, and he was the man to know. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0575.pt|And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0576.pt|Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0577.pt|But well just postpone this. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0578.pt|There was the Emma Louisa. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0579.pt|This is my fifth voyage. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0580.pt|It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtrys mind. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0581.pt|Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0582.pt|Enjoy it he did, but principally for Stewards sake. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0583.pt|I have long noted your thirst unquenchable. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0584.pt|Wonder if hes a lion dog, Charles suggested. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0585.pt|We dont see ourselves as foolish. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0586.pt|He had comparatively no advantages at first. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0587.pt|He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0588.pt|I was sick once -- typhoid. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0589.pt|In a way he is my protege. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0590.pt|We are both children together. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0591.pt|Its only his indigestion I find fault with. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0592.pt|Shed make a good wife for the cashier. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0593.pt|Gad, do I remember it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0594.pt|You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0595.pt|I can see that knife now. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0596.pt|When I cant see beauty in woman I want to die. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0597.pt|His slim fingers closed like steel about Philips. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0598.pt|He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0599.pt|Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0600.pt|Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0601.pt|Id say there was going to be a glorious scrap. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0602.pt|He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0603.pt|His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companions face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0604.pt|Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0605.pt|Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0606.pt|Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0607.pt|They robbed me a few years later. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0608.pt|He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0609.pt|Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0610.pt|I was completely lost in my work. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0611.pt|His slim hands gripped the edges of the table. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0612.pt|He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0613.pt|Philip dropped back into his chair. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0614.pt|If I was out of the game it would be easily made. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0615.pt|MacDougall, my engineer, believes it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0616.pt|It is growing, every day, every hour. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0617.pt|Now, you understand. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0618.pt|You have associated with some of these men. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0619.pt|And theres no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0620.pt|Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0621.pt|All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0622.pt|Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0623.pt|Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0624.pt|He caught himself with a jerk. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0625.pt|How does your wager look now. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0626.pt|He confessed that the sketch had startled him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0627.pt|After all, the picture was only a resemblance. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0628.pt|He wondered, too, where Roscoe was. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0629.pt|Philip knew that she was not an Indian. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0630.pt|In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0631.pt|Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0632.pt|The thought set his blood tingling. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0633.pt|But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0634.pt|Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0635.pt|It wont be for sale. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0636.pt|For a few moments he ate in silence. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0637.pt|Philip did not pursue the subject. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0638.pt|Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0639.pt|Suppose you saw me at work through the window. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0640.pt|He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0641.pt|There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0642.pt|All this day Gregson remained in the cabin. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0643.pt|The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0644.pt|The flush was gone from her face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0645.pt|That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0646.pt|He understood the meaning of the look. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0647.pt|She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0648.pt|Ill give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0649.pt|They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0650.pt|We must achieve our own salvation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0651.pt|In moments of mental energy Philip was restless. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0652.pt|He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0653.pt|Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0654.pt|Now it was missing from the wall. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0655.pt|He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0656.pt|Im going down there with you, and Im going to fight. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0657.pt|Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0658.pt|If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0659.pt|Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0660.pt|Only the chance sound had led him to observe them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0661.pt|Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0662.pt|There was no chance to fire without hitting him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0663.pt|There was no answer from the other side. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0664.pt|Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0665.pt|With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0666.pt|Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0667.pt|In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0668.pt|Before Philip could recover himself Jeannes startled guards were upon him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0669.pt|It is the nearest refuge. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0670.pt|There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0671.pt|The truth of it set Jeanne quivering. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0672.pt|Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0673.pt|You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0674.pt|He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0675.pt|In it there was something that was almost tragedy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0676.pt|Your face is red with blood. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0677.pt|Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0678.pt|He can care for himself. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0679.pt|They will search for us between their camp and Churchill. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0680.pt|Until I die, he exclaimed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0681.pt|Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0682.pt|The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0683.pt|For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0684.pt|I want to die in it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0685.pt|Darkness hid him from Jeanne. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0686.pt|And yet if she came he had no words to say. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0687.pt|He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0688.pt|Within himself he called it no longer his own. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0689.pt|Besides, that noise makes me deaf. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0690.pt|Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0691.pt|Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0692.pt|There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0693.pt|Youre a devil for fighting, and will surely win. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0694.pt|Ill only be in the way. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0695.pt|He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0696.pt|Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0697.pt|I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0698.pt|For a full minute the two men stared into each others face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0699.pt|He was sure, now, of but few things. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0700.pt|It was a miracle, and I owe you my life. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0701.pt|Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0702.pt|Such men believe, when they come together. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0703.pt|The journey was continued at dawn. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0704.pt|Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0705.pt|There was something pathetic in the girls attitude now. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0706.pt|He moved his position, and the illusion was gone. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0707.pt|For two hours not a word passed between them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0708.pt|I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0709.pt|Thats Thorpes, said the young engineer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0710.pt|We saw your light, and thought you wouldnt mind a call. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0711.pt|Billinger may arrive in time. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0712.pt|Theres the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0713.pt|I want my men to work by themselves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0714.pt|Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0715.pt|Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpes men. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0716.pt|Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0717.pt|It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0718.pt|Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded mans right breast. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0719.pt|He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0720.pt|Philip bent low over Pierre. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0721.pt|Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0722.pt|She saw the answer in his face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0723.pt|Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0724.pt|There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0725.pt|There followed a roar that shook the earth. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0726.pt|Blind with rage, he darted in. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0727.pt|In it was the joy of life. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0728.pt|Swiftly his eyes measured the situation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0729.pt|But this little defect did not worry him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0730.pt|And then, steadily, he began to chew. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0731.pt|Together they ate the rabbit. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0732.pt|They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0733.pt|It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0734.pt|Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0735.pt|It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0736.pt|But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0737.pt|Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0738.pt|After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0739.pt|Had it struck squarely it would have killed him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0740.pt|The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0741.pt|Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0742.pt|And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0743.pt|It was steel, a fisher trap. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0744.pt|OW, a wild dog, he growled. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0745.pt|He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0746.pt|That is the strange part of it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0747.pt|His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0748.pt|For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0749.pt|In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0750.pt|She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0751.pt|His teeth shut with a last click. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0752.pt|It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0753.pt|In a flash he was on his feet, facing him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0754.pt|He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factors shoulders. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0755.pt|The moon had already begun its westward decline. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0756.pt|They laughed like two happy children. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0757.pt|He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0758.pt|Fast, but endure. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0759.pt|A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0760.pt|The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0761.pt|He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0762.pt|Then he shouted, Shut up. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0763.pt|He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0764.pt|On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0765.pt|To these he gave castor oil. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0766.pt|Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0767.pt|Sheldon glanced at the thermometer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0768.pt|Ill see to poor Hughie. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0769.pt|Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0770.pt|Also, I want information. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0771.pt|Let them go out and eat with my boys. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0772.pt|I, I beg pardon, he drawled. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0773.pt|And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0774.pt|I was in New York when the crash came. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0775.pt|No, I did not fall among thieves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0776.pt|Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0777.pt|Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0778.pt|I cant go elsewhere, by your own account. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0779.pt|Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0780.pt|He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0781.pt|That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0782.pt|Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0783.pt|He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0784.pt|Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0785.pt|So was Packards finish suicide. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0786.pt|Joan cried, with shining eyes. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0787.pt|Nobody knows how the natives got them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0788.pt|How can you manage all alone, Mr Young. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0789.pt|The planters are already considering the matter. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0790.pt|I use great trouble advisedly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0791.pt|Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0792.pt|We leave the eventuality to time and law. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0793.pt|I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0794.pt|Society is shaken to its foundations. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0795.pt|A month in Australia would finish me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0796.pt|Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0797.pt|You were destroying my life. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0798.pt|Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0799.pt|Im as good as a man, she urged. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0800.pt|You read the quotations in todays paper. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0801.pt|Hes terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0802.pt|Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0803.pt|This is eighteen eighty. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0804.pt|Death is and has been ever since old Maui died. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0805.pt|Some boy, she laughed acquiescence. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0806.pt|Let us talk it over and find a way out. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0807.pt|It is a good property, and worth more than that. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0808.pt|I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0809.pt|Such is my passage engaged on the steamer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0810.pt|The issue was not in doubt. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0811.pt|Well, there are better men in Hawaii, thats all. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0812.pt|Harry Bancroft, Dave lied. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0813.pt|Its a Yankee, Joan cried. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0814.pt|He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0815.pt|They likewise are disinclined to being eaten. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0816.pt|But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0817.pt|The President of the United States was his friend. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0818.pt|Your face was the personification of duplicity. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0819.pt|Shorty turned to their employers. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0820.pt|You were engaged. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0821.pt|I saw it all myself, and it was splendid. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0822.pt|Now run along, and tell them to hurry. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0823.pt|Whats that grub-thief got to do with it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0824.pt|It was a superb picture. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0825.pt|So she said, the irate skipper dashed on. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0826.pt|And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0827.pt|Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0828.pt|Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0829.pt|They just lay off in the bush and plugged away. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0830.pt|The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0831.pt|And there was a dog that barked. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0832.pt|There are four, all low, McCoy answered. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0833.pt|The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0834.pt|The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0835.pt|They had been on the same lay as ourselves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0836.pt|You are positively soulless, he said savagely. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0837.pt|Harrison is still my chauffeur. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0838.pt|The boy grew and prospered. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0839.pt|He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0840.pt|Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0841.pt|I know they are my oysters. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0842.pt|By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0843.pt|They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0844.pt|It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0845.pt|The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0846.pt|At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0847.pt|Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0848.pt|Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0849.pt|Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0850.pt|You fired me out of your house, in short. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0851.pt|Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0852.pt|Its worth eight dollars. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0853.pt|And he did hurt my arm. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0854.pt|Saxons onto her job. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0855.pt|Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0856.pt|But this time it was Saxon who rebelled. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0857.pt|I was not to cry out in the face of fear. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0858.pt|And now put yourself in my place for a moment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0859.pt|The boy threw back his head with pride. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0860.pt|Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0861.pt|Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0862.pt|We could throw stones with our feet. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0863.pt|It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0864.pt|These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0865.pt|Then it was that a strange thing happened. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0866.pt|From the source of light a harsh voice said. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0867.pt|But I did not enjoy it long. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0868.pt|We were now good friends. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0869.pt|Two of the Folk were already up. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0870.pt|Now animals do not like mockery. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0871.pt|He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0872.pt|Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0873.pt|Just the same Id sooner be myself than have book indigestion. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0874.pt|Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0875.pt|But we were without this momentum. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0876.pt|There was one difficulty, however. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0877.pt|The hyena proceeded to dine. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0878.pt|The time was considered auspicious. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0879.pt|Or have they already devised one. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0880.pt|We would not spend another such night. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0881.pt|At first his progress was slow and erratic. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0882.pt|He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0883.pt|The awe of man rushed over him again. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0884.pt|The Fire-Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0885.pt|Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0886.pt|For a much longer time Lop-Ear and I remained and watched. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0887.pt|All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0888.pt|At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0889.pt|Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0890.pt|His hand shot out and clutched Crooked-Leg by the neck. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0891.pt|Miss Brodies smile was slightly sarcastic. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0892.pt|Does the old boy often go off at half-cock that way. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0893.pt|A flying arrow passed between us. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0894.pt|I pulled, suddenly, with all my might. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0895.pt|Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0896.pt|His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0897.pt|It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0898.pt|Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0899.pt|We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0900.pt|We never made another migration. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0901.pt|Nor was Elam Harnish an exception. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0902.pt|A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0903.pt|The 29th very foggy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0904.pt|Dig in; youre sure good, was Daylights answer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0905.pt|The apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0906.pt|He had been born with this endowment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0907.pt|And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0908.pt|Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0909.pt|He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0910.pt|Again he had done the big thing. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0911.pt|Daylight was tired, profoundly tired. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0912.pt|The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0913.pt|Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0914.pt|Their supply of grub was gone. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0915.pt|Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0916.pt|Not till the twentieth of May did the river break. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0917.pt|It was a gigantic inadequacy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0918.pt|Our Mr Howison will call upon you at your hotel. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0919.pt|He had been so easy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0920.pt|Change chairs, Daylight commanded. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0921.pt|Id sooner have my chips back. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0922.pt|They only had a little thirty thousand dollar fire. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0923.pt|His partners had starved and died on the Stewart. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0924.pt|As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0925.pt|It does, was her audacious answer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0926.pt|Oh, its just a novel, a love story. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0927.pt|Whoever lived on the ranch did that. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0928.pt|How old are you, mother. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0929.pt|Here he got a fresh thrill. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0930.pt|It was unobtrusive, yet it was there. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0931.pt|Well, Ill be plumb gosh darned. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0932.pt|These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0933.pt|I play that choice wide open to win. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0934.pt|Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0935.pt|But how are you going to do it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0936.pt|Lots of men take women buggy riding. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0937.pt|Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0938.pt|Theres not an iota of truth in it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0939.pt|But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0940.pt|Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0941.pt|In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0942.pt|Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0943.pt|Matthewson, whos this bookkeeper, Rogers. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0944.pt|Now just what do you want to know. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0945.pt|I want to know how all this is possible. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0946.pt|Its that much junk. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0947.pt|There was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0948.pt|He loved to play Chinese lottery. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0949.pt|The Law of Club and Fang 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0950.pt|The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0951.pt|And as never before, he was ready to obey. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0952.pt|This state of mind comes of an undue prominence of the ego. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0953.pt|There are the canals of China, and the Yang-tse River. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0954.pt|We threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0955.pt|She was built primarily to sail. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0956.pt|In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco there are some crack sailors. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0957.pt|My age, in years, is twenty two. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0958.pt|I forgot how easily I had taught myself from the printed page. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0959.pt|Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0960.pt|Please do not think that I already know it all. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0961.pt|You see, we were teaching ourselves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0962.pt|And now behold the perversity of things. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0963.pt|Yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0964.pt|Mr McVeigh told me about him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0965.pt|Unlike Joshua, he stood in no need of divine assistance. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0966.pt|To say the least, Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0967.pt|Man could not conquer them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0968.pt|Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0969.pt|A scarlet loincloth completed his costume. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0970.pt|I like to speculate upon the glorious future of man. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0971.pt|Christmas is an easy problem compared with a Polynesian giving-feast. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0972.pt|He had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0973.pt|And how would we ever find ourselves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0974.pt|I defy any man to get a Solomon Island sore in California. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0975.pt|A bush chief had died a natural death. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0976.pt|The skippers and Nakatas gymnastics served as a translation without words. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0977.pt|Last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0978.pt|My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0979.pt|It is merely the simple superlative. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0980.pt|I made no more overtures. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0981.pt|Among my minor afflictions, I may mention a new and mysterious one. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0982.pt|The voyage was our idea of a good time. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0983.pt|At sea, Tuesday, March 17, 1908. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0984.pt|Yes, sir, he answered, with cheerful alacrity. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0985.pt|I was still weak from my prolonged immersion. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0986.pt|The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0987.pt|I was beneath the water, suffocating and drowning. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0988.pt|The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0989.pt|The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi-human amphibious breed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0990.pt|I have been robbed, sir, I amended. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0991.pt|You were looking squeamish this afternoon, he began. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0992.pt|How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0993.pt|I learned it myself in English ships. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0994.pt|An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0995.pt|Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0996.pt|Yes, and no, sir, was the slow reply. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0997.pt|And each year something happened, and I did not go. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0998.pt|How in hell did he know it was you in the dark. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_0999.pt|Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually occurring. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1000.pt|You have all the advantage. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1001.pt|The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1002.pt|Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1003.pt|He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1004.pt|Ah, it was sweet in my ears. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1005.pt|He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy pleasure. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1006.pt|It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1007.pt|There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1008.pt|I arose obediently and went down the beach. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1009.pt|The next thing to watch out for is bed sores. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1010.pt|At that moment I got the impression that she was willowy. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1011.pt|Your fathers fifth command, he nodded. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1012.pt|On occasion, on this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1013.pt|She is essentially the life-giving, life-conserving female of the species. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1014.pt|This was when the explosion occurred. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1015.pt|Also, at regular intervals, he would mutter. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1016.pt|It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear looking into. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1017.pt|There were orange-green, gold-green, and a copper-green. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1018.pt|The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1019.pt|The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the Argentine. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1020.pt|The history of our westward-faring race is written in it. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1021.pt|And the Eurasian Chinese-Englishman bowed himself away. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1022.pt|They were babbling and chattering all together. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1023.pt|Too much, he told me, with ominous rolling head. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1024.pt|He is a candidate, rising from the serf class to our class. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1025.pt|We are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1026.pt|The steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of advice. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1027.pt|Well, did they eat. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1028.pt|Famine had been my great ally. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1029.pt|Nowhere in the North is the soil so prolific. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1030.pt|They ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1031.pt|The land exchanged its austere robes for the garb of a smiling wanton. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1032.pt|There were stir and bustle, new faces, and fresh facts. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1033.pt|And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1034.pt|He had become a man very early in life. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1035.pt|I did not think you would be so early. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1036.pt|He did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1037.pt|Mops, sir, eagerly answered the sailor at the wheel. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1038.pt|Some one had thrust a large sheath-knife into his hand. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1039.pt|OBrien emitted a shriek that sank swiftly to a gurgling sob. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1040.pt|Sandel would never become a world champion. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1041.pt|Also, she wouldnt walk. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1042.pt|To my dearest and always appreciated friend, I submit myself. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1043.pt|You used to joyride like the very devil. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1044.pt|They saw each other for the first time in Boston. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1045.pt|Isaac Ford, the austere soldier of the Lord, the old hypocrite. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1046.pt|Eighteen, he added. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1047.pt|His reward should have been peace and repose. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1048.pt|He was an amphibian and a mountaineer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1049.pt|It was sanctification and salvation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1050.pt|The history of the eighteenth century is written, Ernest prompted. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1051.pt|They are not biologists nor sociologists. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1052.pt|The more his opponents grew excited, the more Ernest deliberately excited them. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1053.pt|By virtue of that power we shall remain in power. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1054.pt|One guess will do, Ernest retorted. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1055.pt|Take my advice and accept the vacation. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1056.pt|I could not agree with Ernest. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1057.pt|But such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1058.pt|It is dog eat dog, and you ate them up. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1059.pt|Let us run them for ourselves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1060.pt|It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1061.pt|Very few people knew of the existence of this law. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1062.pt|The very thing, Ernest agreed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1063.pt|Also a fellow Senator, Chauncey Depew, said. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1064.pt|Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1065.pt|Then there was the campaign. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1066.pt|He was manifestly distressed by my coming. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1067.pt|Not a wheel moved in his empire. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1068.pt|The reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1069.pt|Youre going in for grab sharing. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1070.pt|The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent competition. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1071.pt|Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1072.pt|Without discussion, it was the agents provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1073.pt|The task we set ourselves was threefold. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1074.pt|Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1075.pt|The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1076.pt|This the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1077.pt|The mob came on, but it could not advance. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1078.pt|But why continue the tirade, for tirade it was. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1079.pt|After all superfluous flesh is gone what is left is stringy and resistant. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1080.pt|Beyond refusing to sell us food, they left us to ourselves. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1081.pt|He was a merry monarch, especially so for an Asiatic. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1082.pt|What an excited whispering and conferring took place. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1083.pt|Jacob Brinker, who was his roadmate, brought the news. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1084.pt|Thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1085.pt|You yellow giant thing of the frost. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1086.pt|Never so strange a prophet came up to Jerusalem. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1087.pt|We who have endured so much surely can endure a little more. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1088.pt|I have seen myself that one man contemplated by Pascals philosophic eye. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1089.pt|One great drawback to farming in California is our long dry summer. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1090.pt|I remembered the red wine of the Italian rancho, and shuddered inwardly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1091.pt|I said, and dismissed the matter as not worth thinking about. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1092.pt|Then came my boy code. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1093.pt|And wherever I ranged, the way lay along alcohol-drenched roads. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1094.pt|And as we hurried up town, Joe Goose explained. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1095.pt|The scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1096.pt|The life there was healthful and athletic, but too juvenile. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1097.pt|How valiantly I went at it that first day. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1098.pt|It would help to tide me along until I got steady employment. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1099.pt|Did I possess too much vitality. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1100.pt|In his anxiety and solicitude and love they did not count. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1101.pt|He had fulfilled his duty and paid properly. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1102.pt|He knew what taboos he was violating. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1103.pt|Do you value your hide. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1104.pt|You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1105.pt|He plodded on for half an hour, when the hallucination arose again. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1106.pt|Tomorrow or next day it might he gone. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1107.pt|But already he had composed himself. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1108.pt|Zilla relaxed her sour mouth long enough to sigh her satisfaction. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1109.pt|Eggshell is not good to eat. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1110.pt|But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1111.pt|Yea, I will tell thee. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1112.pt|Hans hurled himself upon the prostrate man, striking madly with his fists. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1113.pt|And he thought of Oona, and of her words. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1114.pt|Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1115.pt|The Russian music player, the Count, was her obedient slave. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1116.pt|So far as flags were concerned, they were beyond all jurisdiction. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1117.pt|New idea, he volunteered, brand new idea. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1118.pt|Thirty pounds, said the captain with finality. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1119.pt|The very idea of it was preposterous. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1120.pt|Captain Doanes orders were swiftly obeyed. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1121.pt|Come on, Del Mar challenged. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1122.pt|He had a big chimpanzee that was a winner. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1123.pt|I am sure it must have been some adventure. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1124.pt|That Longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1125.pt|His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1126.pt|Ill tell you, the librarian said with a brightening face. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1127.pt|He read his fragments aloud. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1128.pt|Typhoid -- did I tell you. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1129.pt|But she had become an automaton. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1130.pt|At the best, they were necessary accessories. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1131.pt|You were making them talk shop, Ruth charged him. 
Charmaine/mels/charmaine_1132.pt|Everyone knows the Singapore River, but do you know its source?
